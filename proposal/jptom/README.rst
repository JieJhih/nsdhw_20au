Proposal for Kalman filter 
===========================

This is a template for a proposal that specifies what your project is and the
execution plan.  You are encouraged to use `reStructuredText
<https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`__ (which is employed by this
template).  The plain-text format makes it easier for the instructor to comment
in your GitHub pull requests.  You may use another document format if it is
more suitable to your project.

Basic information
=================

`My project repository <https://github.com/jptom/study-probablistic-robotics/tree/main/nsd-term-project>`_

My base python code is from this book.
This author translated `Probabilistic Robotics <https://www.amazon.com/Probabilistic-Robotics-INTELLIGENT-ROBOTICS-AUTONOMOUS-ebook/dp/B00DJD9LXC>`_ in 2005.
This book introduce it's implementation in python by him in 2019.

Problem to solve
================

.. image:: https://github.com/jptom/nsdhw_20au/edit/proposal-jptom-attempt1/proposal/jptom/image/kalman.jpg

Describe the problem you want to solve.  Include necessary background
information without making it a technical paper.

Some points may help you organize the problem description:

1. The field or industry of the problem.
2. The physics and/or the mathematics behind the problem.
3. The algorithm or numerical method that should be applied for solving the
   problem.
   


Perspective users
=================

Beginner of probabilistic robotics

System architecture
===================

Analyze how your system takes input, produces results, and performs any other
operations.

Describe the system's work flow.  You may consider to use a flow chart but it
is not required.

Specify the constraints assume in your system.  Describe how it is modularized.

API description
===============

Show how a user programmatically uses your system.  You are supposed to
implement the system using both C++ and Python.  Describe how a user writes a
script in the system.  If you provide API in both C++ and Python, describe
both.

Engineering infrastructure
==========================

Describe how you plan to put together the build system, testing framework, and
documentation.  Show how you will do version control.

You may use continuous integration, but it is not required.  If you use it,
describe how it works in your code development.

Quadratic Programming Solver

Basic information
#################

* A Numerical Optimizer For Quadratic Functions with or without equality/inequality constraints

* The optimizer will be implemented in C. (Not C++ since author will like to integrate it into embedded device later.)

* The future goal of this project is to integrate it in to embedded devices, which requires more optimizations to
  speed up the code. I will expect myself to finish the first version that can be ran on a normal personal computer
  for now.

Problem to solve
################

Designing a quadratic programming solver for computing resource restricted embedded system (cpu clock rate ~180Mhz)

**What is Quadratic Programming?**

.. image:: qp_formula.PNG

We call the variable x **optimization variables**,

the first term **objective function** or **cost function**,

the second term **equality constraints**,

and the third term **inequality constraints**.

**Why do we need Quadratic Programming?**

Quadratic Programming shows up frequently in robotics like control or trajectory planning.

* For example, we may want to map force / torque (6 degree total) to motors number that are greater than 6,
then we are facing to have infinite choice of motor thrust.

* To solve the problem, we can choose the one combination which hs the lowest energy (in the sense of quadratic function)

There are two fantasic examples to illustate this problem:

Perspective users
#################

I will expect the user may have the following backgrounds:

1. Robotics engineers

2. Control engineerss

Usually the problem set up will like: We want to make robots to do something, but there are multiple choices to go,
so we construct a quadratic cost function to analogize the energy and find the least energy costing strategy.

System architecture

API description
###############

we use **qp_t** datatype to store all informations that the solver need to solve the problem

* To set up the optimization variables, we call:

``void qp_solve_set_optimization_variable(qp_t *qp, vector_t *x);``

* To set up the objective function, we call:

``void qp_solve_set_cost_function(qp_t *qp, matrix_t *P, vector_t *q, vector_t *r);``

* To set up the equality constraints, we call:

``void qp_solve_set_equality_constraints(qp_t *qp, matrix_t *A, matrix_t *b);``

* To set up the upper bound of the inequality constraints, we call:

``void qp_solve_set_upper_bound_inequality_constraints(qp_t *qp, vector *ub);``

* TO set up the lower bound of the inequality constraints, we call:

``void qp_solve_set_lower_bound_inequality_constraints(qp_t *qp, vector *lb);``

* To start solving the quadratic programming problem, we call:

bool qp_solve_start(qp_t);
